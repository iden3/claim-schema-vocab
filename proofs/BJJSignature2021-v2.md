# issuerData

Represents all information about issuer that was used for signature proof generation

# authClaim

auth claim  is an information about BJJ Claim of issuer

# state

state includes basic information of issuer identity

# value

state value

# rootOfRoots

A merkle tree of Roots is generated by the Issuer and uploaded to the Smart Contract. This allows the recipients to hide the particular Root they are using to prove a claim, and to prove that the Root is valid by proving inclusion in the Roots Tree of the Issuer.

# claimsTreeRoot

A merkle tree of claim information according to specification

# revocationTreeRoot

Every Identity has a ClT (Claim Tree) and a separate ReT (Revocation Tree). While the claim tree would be private and only the root public, the revocation tree would be entirely public. The roots of both trees (ClT and ReT) are linked via the IdS (Identity State) which is published in the Smart Contract. The revocation tree could be published in IPFS or any other public storage system

# id

Issuer Identifier

# created

Time in Unix when signature has been created


# mtp

Sparse merkle tree proof of the auth claim of the issuer

# revocationStatus

Structure that contains information to fetch revocation status of the issuer auth claim

# signature

Signature value in hex format
